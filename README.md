# Reaction Diffusion Texturing
In this project, a programmed experiment is presented that can synthesize textures generated from reaction-diffusion based processes that can adapt to the geometry of a given surface. Textures that are synthesized directly onto a given geometric surface, as opposed using texture images to be mapped onto the given surface, hopes to enable a multitude of benefits including: better texture integration with geometry, dynamic levels of texture detail, and the ability to adapt to dynamic environments (such as the changing of geometry). Modelling reaction-diffusion processes with cellular automata to generate textures, inspired from Greg Turks implementation. 

The Gierer-Meinhardt model is a reaction-diffusion model that explains biological pattern formation, particularly in the context of morphogenesis. The model consists of an activator-inhibitor system, where the activator promotes the production of itself and the inhibitor, whereas the inhibitor supresses the production of the activator. The model can be represented under the equations:

Where a and h are the concentrations of the activator and inhibitor respectively, values 𝐷𝑎 and 𝐷ℎ are the diffusion coefficients of the activator and inhibitor respectively, and 𝜌, 𝜇, 𝜎, 𝜈, and 𝛾 are reaction rate constants.

Meinhardt’s book ‘Models of Biological Pattern Formation’ (Meinhardt, 1982) describes a extension of the existing model capable of creating stripe-formations found in biology. This extension of the model incorporates additional terms, capturing the dynamics of more complicated patterns using a five-chemical system with the chemicals: G1, G2, R, S1 and S2. The Chemicals G1 and G2 are both autocatalytic feedback loops meaning that an initial small amount of the substances trigger its own synthesis, such that synthesizing more of the substance only further accelerates its production of the chemical. These chemicals are responsible for representing the stripes, which must appear mutually exclusive from one another. This is done through the use of a common repressor R, which regulates the production of the activators. This can be seen in the definitions of the G chemicals where their production is inversely proportional to R. As a result, chemical R ensures that values G1 and G2 can never both be present at one location. Chemicals S1 and S2 are diffusible substances that provide long-ranging help of one feedback system to another, to G2 and G1 respectively.

Turk’s implementation is based on the premise of performing reaction-diffusion directly on the mesh by creating ‘cells’ on its surface which act as the medium for the reactiondiffusion processes. This is achieved by resampling the mesh uniformly with a set of approximately equidistant points, which can be done in a variety of different ways. Following this, Voronoi regions to identify adjacencies of nearby points which is to be used as alternatives to a cells neighbouring region. By establishing a method to create a ‘grid’ over the surface of an object, any process that works on a 2-dimensional grid can be adapted. As a result the texture can be constructed directly as a consequence of the objects geometry, conforming to the objects shape without any visible seams.
